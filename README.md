# Monotonic discretized schemes for the Schrödinger equation

This work deals with the optimal control of a quantum systems, modeled here by the Schrödinger equation. The target is to build a controls for such systems. A methods commonly used to achieve this is the Krotov method. Initially proposed by Krotov and Feldman (1978, 1983), this method have been further extended in (Tannor, 1992), (Zhu, 1998) and (Maday, 2003).

I implemented two stable, monotonic time and space discretization to build an optimal quantum control.
